## Statistics

Seeing how much time you spend on each activity is helpful to make the necessary changes in your schedule. This is the reason why there is an opportunity to see different statistics that made from your activities.
The charts were made with [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart)!

#### Personal statistics

Statistics made from your own data.
